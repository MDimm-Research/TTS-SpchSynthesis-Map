"Cardinal Mezzofanti who was an Italian Cardinal who was born in 1774 and had been tested in 39 languages, but some say knew as many as 72; so I looked at how he learned languages, and one of the ways he did that for instance was, he would have native speakers translate the Lordâ€™s Prayer into their native language for him." ~ Tim Ferriss
